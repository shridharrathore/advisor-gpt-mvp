   - Secondary User: Team Lead(to monitor and review performance of Chatbot)

## MVP Scope
   - Clean, consistent and smooth UI and UX
   - Customer Support Agent to ask questions which will help him effectively respond to query recieved from customer
   - Chatbot to generate guided response with steps along with citations
   - Customer Support Agent to provide feedback on response generated by chatbot
   - Chatbot to generate audit log per response
   - Team Lead to monitor and review periodic performance of chatbot
   - Chatbot to generate daily markdown summary of performance
   - Responsible AI, Security, Privacy features to be built in such as
        - Agent Only Acess(internal tool), no customer access
        - PII redaction before indexing
        - Per-response audit JSONL(inputs, citations, confidence, latency, outcome)
        - Version tags(model/prompt) on every record
        - Fairness and bias check


## Technical Stack
   - Frontend :React
   - Backend : Python, FastAPI
   - Vector Database : ChromaDB
   - LLM : OpenAI 
   - Embedding Model : OpenAI

## RAG Contract
    - synthetic KB + tags {product, doc_type, clause_id}, chunking policy(chunk_size = 800, chunk_overlap = 120, top_k=4, min_score=0.35), filters; fixed output JSON {answer, steps[], cited_spans[], confidence, disclaimers}; evidence gate + fallback.

## UI/UX
    - Feedback capture(like/dislike + reason) and Accept/Edit flags(and note they're logged)
    - 3-pane Agent Workbench (Case/Query | Draft Answer | Evidence with citations & filters).

## Non Functional Requirements/Observability
    -  Basic Latency Statistics(P50/P95) sourced from logs
    - JSONL

## Success and Evaluation 
    - Tiny eval run(retrieval@k, groundedness) with daily markdown summary
    - Latency P95< 3s
    - retrieval@3
    - groundedness >= 95%
